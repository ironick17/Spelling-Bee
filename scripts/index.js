/**
 * This app relies on getting information from the NY Times Spelling Bee via
 * HTTP. I use the fetch function for this. I also use fetch for accessing my
 * json in the cloud at jsonbin.io.
 *
 * Since the fetch function is asynchronous function that returns a promise it
 * took me quite a while to figure out JS promises.
 *
 * Here is a short description of how I currently think about JS promises: I
 * think a promise as a special kind of JS object or function. Usually to access
 * the value of an object you simply use its name in an expression, eg "let foo
 * = myThing", and the access the result of a function you simply use its name
 * followed by "()", eg "let foo = myThing()". But with a promise, using its
 * name in an expression is like using the name of a function NOT followed by
 * "()", all it does is access the function object itself, not invoke it for a
 * return value, eg "let foo = myFunction". The ONLY way to access the value
 * returned by a promise is to use the method ".then". This method isn't the
 * typical accessor method, eg "let foo = myThing.getValue", because the .then
 * method actually takes a callback function as an argument. It is this callback
 * function that will be passed the value/result of the promise. What's cool
 * about the .then method is that you can invoke it on the promise whenever you
 * want, eg even LONG AFTER the promise has been resolved. This is VERY
 * different from a normal function. With a normal function, you can only get
 * its return result ONCE.
 *
 * At this point, I'll introduce the term "promissory". I call a function that
 * is actually a promise a "promissory function" and likewise for "promissory
 * object". Thus, the cool thing about a promissory function is that its result
 * can be accessed at any time during the excution of an application and at many
 * different locations in different functions comprising the app. I recently
 * discovered that the official name for what I call a promissory, is a
 * thennable: A thennable is an object that defines a then method.
 *
 * One last insight. Promise chaining, which I use below, isn't anthing special.
 * It just enables you to fire off a series of async functions where the next
 * function doesn't run until the previous one has resolved. An even bigger
 * insight is that the function passed as an argument to the .then method DOES
 * NOT have to be asynch. Invoking the .then method returns a promise, so the
 * regular, synchronous function is now wrapped in a promise, so the only way to
 * access its return value is to invoke ITS .then method. This is the basis of
 * .then chaining.
